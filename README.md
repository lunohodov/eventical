# EVE Cal [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lunohodov/evecal.svg?style=svg&circle-token=b79e0b14abfe04bb761c1e6008af3f7e33b2fb99)](https://circleci.com/gh/lunohodov/evecal)

Instant iCal feeds for your EVE Online calendar(s).

## How It Works

#### Convenient out-of-game access

Use your favourite calendar app on the desktop or mobile. Outlook,
Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, or phone's native - you choose.

Times are adjusted and shown in your own time-zone. No more missed events!

#### Keep everyone in the loop

Having a single location for scheduled incursion runs, mining operations,
or the occasional roam keeps everyone on the same page.

#### You're always in control

You decide who to share with - individual characters, everyone in a corporation
or alliance, or the whole Universe.

Sharing can be stopped at anytime.
