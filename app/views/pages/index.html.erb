    <strong class="underline-gradient">Before eve-calendars:</strong>
    EVE Online‘s calendar is disconnected from your daily agenda, you fail to notice overlaps, deal with time zones, and events slip.
    <strong class="underline-gradient">After eve-calendars:</strong>
    Your EVE Online and daily agendas are side by side, overlaps are easy to spot, times are in your time zone, and you take part in the game.

  <h2 class="font-weight-bolder mt-5">Side by side, not aside.</h2>

  <p>
  With EVE Online’s calendar available only in-game, people use additional means to organize and share events. As a result your agenda is spread out across the game client,
  calendar apps, corporation/alliance forums etc. Updates are tough to follow, overlaps hard to see, and you miss events.
  </p>


  <p>
  <strong class="underline-gradient">But with eve-calendars, you’ll see</strong> everything together, access game‘s calendar straight from your favourite calendar app, notice overlaps, and know which event you can take part in.
